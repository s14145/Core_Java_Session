=> What methods do you need to add to each of Car and Bicycle to get this code fragment to compile (setting aside the missing constructors)?
Ans: We need to override methods declared in IVehicle interface by providing implementation to compile the code.

=> Does having a class implement an interface change how you write its constructor?
Ans: Yes, we need to be aware that interface cannot have constructor so object of interface cannot be created.

=> Should builtBefore be added to the IVehicle interface? Why or why not?
Ans: Yes, builtBefore method should be added to the IVehicle interface as it is a common method that could be shared with IVehicle implementation classes Car and Bicycle.
Bicycle class can also have year data member and builtBefore method to indicate if it was built before the given year.

=> In the Examples class, you want to define a Bicycle as follows:
___ newKidsBike = new Bicycle(0, 1);
=> Which types can you use in the blank line (without causing a compile error just with this single line)?
Ans: We can use either interface IVehicle or implementation class Bicycle in the blank line without causing compile error.
IVehicle newKidsBike = new Bicycle(0, 1);
Bicycle newKidsBike1 = new Bicycle(0, 1);
