The different types of inheritance are as follows:

1. Single Inheritance: A child class is inheriting states and behaviors from only one parent class. For e.g.: Dog class
extends Animal class. Dog is child class of Animal parent class.
2. Multi-level Inheritance: A class inheriting states and behaviors from a class which also is inheriting from another
class. For e.g.: Child class extends Father class and Father class extends GrandFather class
3. Hierarchical Inheritance:  If multiple classes are inheriting from a single parent class then it is a hierarchical
inheritance. For e.g.: Square class and Rectangle class extends Shape class
4. Hybrid Inheritance: It is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. For e.g.: Honda class and Toyota class
extends Car class which is hierarchical inheritance. Car class extends Vehicle class which is single inheritance.
Combination of hierarchical and single inheritance form hybrid inheritance.
