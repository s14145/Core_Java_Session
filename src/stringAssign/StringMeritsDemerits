String Immutable class
Merits:
1. It is thread safe to be used in multi-threaded environment which means only one thread is able to access string resource at a time.
2. String constant pool (SCP) is possible as string is immutable class which is used by JVM to optimize memory management.
3. String is a popular data type used heavily with HashMap data structure because of its immutable characteristics.

Demerits:
1. Any modification on String will create a new object occupying heap memory.
