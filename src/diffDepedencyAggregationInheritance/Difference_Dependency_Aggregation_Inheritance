Difference between Dependency, Aggregation and Inheritance:
1. Dependency: It means one class is dependent on another class. If two classes are dependent on each other then we cannot
create an object of one class without having object of dependent class. For eg: There is dependency between Student class Address class.
2. Aggregation: It is a weaker form of association in which both entities can survive individually which means ending one entity will
not affect another entity. It represents "Has-A" relationship. For eg: Cart Has-A product
3. Inheritance: It means when one class inherits properties and behaviors of parent class. It represents "Is-A" relationship. For eg: Apple is a Fruit.
